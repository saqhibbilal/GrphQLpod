# Tawasul - Startup Ecosystem Knowledge Graph Project

## Project Overview
Build a mini knowledge graph for the startup ecosystem using GraphQL to demonstrate relationships between founders, startups, and investors.

## Goals
- Show how founders, startups, and investors are connected
- Allow users to explore relationships with nested queries
- Demonstrate why GraphQL > REST when dealing with highly relational data
- Simple, clean project for learning purposes

## Features
- Query Relationships (e.g., "Show me all FinTech startups and who invested in them")
- Filtering (Filter startups by industry: FinTech, HealthTech, EdTech)
- Nested Data (Fetch founder → startup → investors in one query)

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React 18 + Vite (faster than Create React App)
- Apollo Client for GraphQL consumption
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Router for navigation

### Backend
- Node.js + Apollo Server (GraphQL)
- SQLite database (Docker containerized)
- GraphQL Code Generator for type safety

### Docker
- SQLite database in Docker container
- Development environment with hot reload
- Production-ready setup

## Data Model
```graphql
type Founder {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  bio: String
  startups: [Startup!]!
}

type Startup {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  description: String
  industry: Industry!
  founders: [Founder!]!
  investors: [Investor!]!
  fundingRounds: [FundingRound!]!
}

type Investor {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  type: InvestorType!
  startups: [Startup!]!
}

enum Industry {
  FINTECH
  HEALTHTECH
  EDTECH
  ECOMMERCE
  AI_ML
  CYBERSECURITY
}

enum InvestorType {
  VC
  ANGEL
  CORPORATE
  CROWDFUNDING
}
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Frontend Foundation (Start Here!)
**Goal**: Get a working UI with mock data for immediate testing

**Steps:**
1. Setup React App with Apollo Client
2. Create Mock GraphQL Server (using @graphql-tools/mock)
3. Build Basic UI Components:
   - Startup list/grid
   - Founder cards
   - Investor profiles
   - Search/filter interface
4. Test UI Interactions with mock data

### Phase 2: Backend Infrastructure
**Goal**: Set up real GraphQL backend with Docker

**Steps:**
1. Setup Docker Environment
   - docker-compose.yml for SQLite
   - Database volume for persistence
2. Create Apollo Server
   - GraphQL schema definition
   - Basic resolvers
3. Setup SQLite Database
   - Tables for founders, startups, investors
   - Seed data for testing

### Phase 3: Backend-Frontend Integration
**Goal**: Connect real backend to frontend

**Steps:**
1. Replace Mock Data with real GraphQL queries
2. Test All UI Features with real data
3. Optimize Queries and error handling

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
**Goal**: Demonstrate GraphQL power

**Steps:**
1. Complex Nested Queries
2. Advanced Filtering
3. Real-time Updates (optional)
4. Performance Optimization

## Sample GraphQL Queries

### Get all FinTech startups with their founders and investors
```graphql
query FinTechStartups {
  startups(industry: FINTECH) {
    name
    description
    founders {
      name
      bio
    }
    investors {
      name
      type
    }
  }
}
```

### Find a founder and all their startup connections
```graphql
query FounderNetwork($founderId: ID!) {
  founder(id: $founderId) {
    name
    startups {
      name
      investors {
        name
        type
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Docker Configuration
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  database:
    image: alpine:latest
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
    command: sh -c "apk add --no-cache sqlite && sqlite3 /data/startups.db"
  
  backend:
    build: ./backend
    ports:
      - "4000:4000"
    volumes:
      - ./backend:/app
    depends_on:
      - database
  
  frontend:
    build: ./frontend
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - ./frontend:/app
```

## Mock Data Structure (for Phase 1)
```javascript
const mockData = {
  founders: [
    {
      id: "1",
      name: "Sarah Chen",
      bio: "Former Google engineer, FinTech enthusiast",
      startups: ["startup-1", "startup-2"]
    }
  ],
  startups: [
    {
      id: "startup-1",
      name: "PayFlow",
      industry: "FINTECH",
      founders: ["1"],
      investors: ["investor-1"]
    }
  ],
  investors: [
    {
      id: "investor-1",
      name: "Sequoia Capital",
      type: "VC"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Why Frontend-First Approach?
1. Immediate Visual Feedback - See your app working right away
2. Easier Testing - Mock data lets you test UI without backend complexity
3. Better Planning - UI helps define what GraphQL queries you actually need
4. Faster Iteration - Change UI without restarting backend

## Key GraphQL Features to Demonstrate
- Single Request: Get founder → startups → investors in one query
- Field Selection: Choose exactly what data you need
- Nested Filtering: Filter by industry, investor type, etc.
- Schema Introspection: Auto-generated documentation

## Next Steps
1. Create React app with Vite
2. Setup Apollo Client with mock server
3. Build basic UI components
4. Test with mock data
5. Move to backend setup with Docker
6. Connect real backend to frontend
7. Implement advanced GraphQL features

## Learning Outcomes
- Understand GraphQL vs REST for relational data
- Experience Apollo Server and Client
- Learn Docker basics for development
- Build modern React applications
- Understand database relationships and queries
